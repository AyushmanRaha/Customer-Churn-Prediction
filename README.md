# Customer Churn Prediction Model
Machine Learning model for proactive customer churn prediction and retention strategy development built using Tensorflow!

# ðŸ“Œ Project Overview:
This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a telco dataset and exploring strategies for proactive customer retention. The goal is to build a dynamic pipeline that can handle different CSV files of similar format, train machine learning models, and present actionable insights.

The project is work in progress and currently under development.

# ðŸŽ¯ Objectives:
1. Build a machine learning pipeline that dynamically ingests telco CSV data.

2. Structure the code into functional Python modules with Jupyter notebooks for demonstration, execution, and visualization.

3. Automate execution via a script to run the pipeline and generate outputs.

4. Evaluate and compare model performance, highlight data issues, and provide churn insights.

5.Extend predictions into actionable retention strategies for high-risk customers.

# ðŸ‘‰ This README will evolve as the project matures.
